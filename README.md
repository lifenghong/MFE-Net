# MFE-Net：A New Motion Feature-Enhanced Multiframe Spatial–Temporal Infrared Target Detection Network

##Dataset:

The dataset can be obtained at. https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/mirsat-ql-0 DOI:10.21227/78st-y656
The dataset consists of 100 sequences, totaling 12,552 images, and employs a mask-based annotation approach. The MIRSat-QL dataset has the following characteristics: it is a semisimulated synthetic dataset combining real satellite imagery data and real target objects, and it contains targets with various motion speeds,SNRs, and scales, as well as diverse and complex backgrounds such as mountains, oceans, clouds, and urban areas, wherethe background motion speeds also differ.
